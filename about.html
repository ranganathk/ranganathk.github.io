  <h1>About</h1>
  <p>I am a full stack web developer. I work on the Rails framework which is based on the Ruby language. I graduated from IIT Madras with a dual degree in Naval Architecture and Ocean Engineering. I have built multiple products till date along with learning various technologies at CodeAstra. Using my problem solving ability to build products that solve daily issues excites me greatly. My passion in web development germinated from my desire to express myself and be creative, and this led me to full stack development.</p>
